## Answer 1:
In this, the points are sorted in the ascending order, i.e. if we have x1,x2 and x3,x4, if x1>x2 we will swap this. Same rule goes with x3,x4.
Now if, x1>x3 we will swap both the points. Further we will check if x3 lies between x1 and x2. If true, return overlapping else return not overlapping
